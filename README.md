Please forgive the construction üèóÔ∏è.  I'm still working on getting my Github setup and adding projects to it.

I'm interested in further developing my coding skills and would love to help out with an existing project.  I'm very good with front-end design and development.

If you are interested in chatting you can find me on Discord under ‚ú® Jinni#8312 ‚ú®.  I look forward to meeting you!

Thank you for checking out my Github!
